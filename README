Software center for linux deepin.

* Quick start:
  Switch `src' directory to execute `main' like below command: 
      cd ./src && ./main
	  
* For Ubuntu or other Debian system:
  In principle, deepin software center can run on all Debian system.
  
  Only reason that it can't running on Ubuntu or other Debian system 
  is we use recommend many third-party softwares in home page of software center.
  Because those third-party softwares just exist in deepin repository, 
  so software center will startup failed if it can't find those softwares in local system.

  There have two solution to fix this problem:
  1) Add deepin repository in your local system.
  2) Change recommend software list with your system.
